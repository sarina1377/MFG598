# MFG598
Final Project
This project aims for vegetation detection using KNN Ml. python packaes used are as follow:
Scikit
opencv
Matplot
Numpy
There are to scripts called "train_data" and "train+validation". In "train_data" the train data including the color features are collected from two images " train_1" and "train_2".
and then in the second script, the validation image is analyzed, and then KNN model is trained.
The output of this script is the model accuracy, confusion matrix and vegetation percentage of the validation image
